# WebDev-GIS-Health-Equity

## What social problem is being addressed?
This project seeks to address an issue regarding health equity (especially among those on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum) by identifying regions that suffer from various issues in relation to areas of public health. The issues being evaluated in identifying these regions include things such as:
- Distance to grocery stores (for people with low income who may/may not have constant, reliable access to transportation)
- Food insecurity
- Access to general and specialized health services (Medically underserved area designation)
- Level of poverty
- Access to exercise facilities/opportunities
- Obesity rates
- Population density/amount of available housing
### The local community or non-profit that is being empowered by your application
At this time, we have no specific non-profit in mind. We're hoping to focus on research specifically within the state of California due to our ability to interpret and gather insight regarding this state. It would also be easier to acquire locally sourced data or, at the very least, identify sources from which to acquire such data as a result of our familiarity with the state and its available resources/non-profit organizations. Our hope with this project is that a non-profit organization focusing on serving the most needy/underserved areas can use the map to identify areas to focus work on.

## What problems you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical).
### Technical Problems
There are many variables we are hoping to investigate and as of the moment, we only mildly understand the connections between those variables and their impact on public health. Some additional research may be needed to demonstrate that certain variables (such as population denity and access to exercise facility) have impact on the lives of low-income people. In addition, it might be difficult to find information for all of these very different variables or to use them in a meaningful way. There might not be enough information provided regarding low-income people in certain counties, let alone cities, through which we can gather the data specified above. The large number of variables that we have brainstormed when conceiving the project might lead to an overcomplicated project as well, that may not be feasible to implement in its entirety given only a basic understanding of JavaScript and QGIS. Another issue with these variables and then ature of them is to figure out a timeframe that our map covers, whether it be tracking these variables over the past decade, the past few years, or to keep them tracking data that is as up-to-date as possible.
### Ethical Problems
Firstly, we have made some major assumptions in regards to what people on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum might need in order to be considered healthy. This could be resolved through things such as local surveys, but the nature of the current vision of our project involves large datasets that are likely sourced from websites hosting public health data in order to create visualizations. There is the matter of making sure surveyed participants cannot be personally identified by our findings as well. Furthermore, a failure or misunderstanding in the ties between socioeconomic status and health could lead to the encouragement of providing aid to improperly targetted areas (targeting areas in special need is a priority of this project) that might prove harmful to those areas. Scrutiny of our analysis and dataset would be necessary in dealing with this.
