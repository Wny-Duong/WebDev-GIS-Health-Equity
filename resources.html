                <p>SNAP provides nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food and move towards self-sufficiency. The program is administered by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) through its nationwide network of FNS field offices. Local FNS field offices are responsible for the licensing and monitoring of retail food stores participating in SNAP.</p>
                <p>SNAP is targeted toward the most at-risk citizens, predominantly serving households with children, elderly or disabled members. Nearly half of all SNAP participants are children.</p>
